            <h1>Welcome to my story :)</h1>
            <p>CERAMICS started as a dream on my school days. I wanted to feel the clay, to mold the clay. It gave me peace. But it took time to start. It was "just another of my many dreams". <br>I purchased the clay and I started to work. I like to make pieces by hand, molding them with my hands, which makes them unique, because I can't never replicate them, and I love that. If you think about it, even twins aren't equal. They have their differences. Everyone and everything is one, beautiful with their flaws. Nothing is perfect. And I want to give you my imperfections. <br>So yeah, welcome to my work babez.</p>
